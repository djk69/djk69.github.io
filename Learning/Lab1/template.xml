<p>For this module we will be using Oracle Virtual Box</p>

<p>A hypervisor can run multiple virtual machines on a single host computer. Each virtual machine runs its own operating system. The number of virtual machines that can run at the same time depends on the host machine&rsquo;s hardware resources. The hypervisor allocates the physical system resources, such as CPU, RAM, and hard drive, to each virtual machine as needed. This ensures that the operation of one virtual machine does not interfere with another.</p>
